# Knapsack Problem

## Overview

This repository is part of Assignment 1, where we explore various search algorithms to solve the classic knapsack problem. Our primary objective is to gain hands-on experience with an experimental approach, allowing us to compare the performance of three different search algorithms and report their comparative results.

## Problem Statement

The classic knapsack problem involves selecting a combination of items from a given set, each with its own weight and value, in a way that maximizes the total value while keeping the total weight within a predefined limit (the "knapsack" capacity). This is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with various real-world applications.

## Algorithms

In this assignment, we implement and test three different search algorithms for solving the knapsack problem:

1. Greedy Algorithm
2. simulated annealing
3. Genetic Algorithm
